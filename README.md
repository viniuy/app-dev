#**My favorite series is The Game of Thrones**
##I would highly suggest watching GOT because the storyline is so good and the plot is so diverse

Here are some of my favorite characters in GOT
1. **Daenerys Targaryen**
2. **Tyrion Lannister**
3. **Ned Stark**

>I love these characters because of their roles that they are playing as, Ned's Stark death is highly influencial throughout the show but Daenerys Targaryen takes the cake
